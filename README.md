# Accurate bidiagonal decomposition of collocation matrices of weighted φ-transformed systems


In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of collocation matrices of different weighted φ-transformed systems are provided.

1. In [Weighted_Distribution](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_NLAA_2020/tree/main/Weighted_Distribution) the bidiagonal decompositions of the collocation matrices of  different distributions are provided. 
2. In [Weighted_general_rational_bases] (https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_NLAA_2020/tree/main/Weighted_rational_bases/General_rational_basis) the bidiagonal decomposition of the collocation matrices of a general class of rational bases are provided.
3. In [Weighted_particular_rational_bases](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_NLA_2020/tree/main/Weighted_rational_bases/Particular_rational_basis) the bidiagonal decomposition of the collocation matrices of a particular class of rational bases are provided.
4. In [Curve_fitting_HRA_general_rational_bases](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_NLA_2020/tree/main/App_CurveFittingHRA/Curve_fitting_HRA_general_rational_bases) a Matlab application with the least square method for fitting the given set of data points from known curves by the curves obtained with a general class of rational bases is provided. In the article "Accurate bidiagonal decomposition of collocation matrices of weighted φ-transformed systems"  we have obtained algorithms for the computation of the bidiagonal decomposition  of square collocation matrices of a general class of rational bases.  Now, we generalize the mentioned bidiagonal decomposition to the case of rectangular collocation matrices. 
5. In [Curve_fitting_HRA_particular_bases](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_NLA_2020/tree/main/App_CurveFittingHRA/Curve_fitting_HRA_particular_rational_bases) a Matlab application  with the least square method for fitting the given set of data points from known curves by the curves obtained with a particular class of rational bases is provided. In the article "Accurate bidiagonal decomposition of collocation matrices of weighted φ-transformed systems"  we have obtained algorithms for the computation of the bidiagonal decomposition  of square collocation matrices of a particular class of rational bases.  Now, we generalize the mentioned bidiagonal decomposition to the case of rectangular collocation matrices. 


In all the experiments we use the Matlab functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html.

The implementation uses Matlab 2020b.
